# Connectivity WG

**Visit our website: https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/**

This repository is dedicated to the Connectivity Working Group. We focus on writing free, open specifications for utilities and other central entities to provide discovery, registration, connectivity, and profile management abilities to third party entities.

We are part of the [Carbon Data Specification Consortium (CDSC)](https://carbondataspec.org/), an [LFEnergy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) project at the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects).

## Stuff you can do

* Check out our website: https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/
* Read about the [use cases](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/use-cases) we want to support with our specifications.
* Read our [specifications](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/specs), along with any [open issues](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity/pulls).
* Join the [mailing list](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/cdsc-connectivity-wg) to get notified about our upcoming meetings on our [calendar](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/cdsc-connectivity-wg/calendar).
* Take part in discussions in the **#cdsc-connectivity-wg** channel in the [LF Energy Slack](https://slack.lfenergy.org)

## Contributing

Want to participate? Great! We're an open organization, so we welcome any company or individual who wants to provide input.

### Things anyone can do (no membership required):

* Join and participate in general discussion on the [mailing list](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/cdsc-connectivity-wg) or [Slack channel](https://slack.lfenergy.org) (`#cdsc-connectivity-wg`).
* Ask or answer questions on the [mailing list](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/cdsc-connectivity-wg) or [Slack channel](https://slack.lfenergy.org) (`#cdsc-connectivity-wg`).
* Attend and participate in meetings on our [calendar](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/cdsc-connectivity-wg/calendar).
* File or comment on an [issue](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity/issues) in our [repository](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity).
* Comment on [pull requests](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity/pulls).
* Fork our [repository](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity) and play around with our code and documentation on your own (we're open source!).

### Things you can do if you become an [LFESS member](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/lfess) (it's free!):

* Contribute comments, suggestions, or other content that will be included in our [specifications](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/specs).
* Open [pull requests](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity/pulls) with proposed changes to our [repository](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity) or [specifications](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/specs).

NOTE: It's okay if you're not yet an [LFESS member](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/lfess) and comment on something (spec, issue, pull request, mailing list, slack discussion, etc.), and we want your input to be incorporated into our specifications. We'll just ask you to [join LFESS](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/lfess#join) before we can merge your suggestions into the specifications.

## Scope

This working group focuses on writing free, open specifications for utilities and other central entities to provide discovery, registration, connectivity, and profile management abilities to third party entities.

By providing standardized protocols for these abilities, utilities and other central entities can significantly scale and streamline adoption and integration of carbon tracking platforms, energy management service providers, energy flexibility providers, and other entities that can accelerate the energy transition.

See the [Use Cases](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/use-cases) for which we are writing specifications to address, along with what data types and functionalities will need to be specified to accommodate those use cases.

See also the items specifically [not in scope](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/use-cases#not-in-scope).

Any changes of Scope or Use Cases are not retroactive.
